# Rest API


This is an assignment to ensure you know how to create a REST API using ExpressJS.

    Use express-generator to create an ExpressJS app
    Start the server and test it using Postman (or similar tool) 
    Modify your server to do the following using a resource called "student":
        GET a list of students
        GET a single student by ID
        PUT a single student by ID (log results)
        POST a single student by ID (log results) 
        DELETE a single student by ID (log results)

Post your code to your weekly project Github Repo.
